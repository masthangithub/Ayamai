    This is intentionally minimal‚Äîjust enough to prototype the concept. From here, we could:

- Expand it to use **real embeddings** from sentence-transformers.
- Store dream logs in a **graph DB** for symbolic memory linking.
- Trigger dreams from stimuli (new U, high novelty, cyclic boredom).
- Layer this with a **U‚ÜîD transformer** that tries to formalize these emergent thoughts.
