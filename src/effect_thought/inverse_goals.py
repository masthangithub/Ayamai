# This module allows AYAMAI to simulate reverse causal reasoning:
# - Start with a desired emotional state (like "joy" or "awe")  
# - Generate possible past events or memories that could lead to that feeling

# - This can be used to inspire new dreams, stories, or reflections


# - It helps the system explore how different emotions might shape its understanding of the world# -
#  This is a prototype; future versions could integrate with LLMs for richer narrative generation

"""
# This is a prototype; future versions could integrate with LLMs for richer narrative generation
# This module takes in a desired emotion (e.g., ‚Äúcuriosity‚Äù) and simulates the possible upstream 
# cognitive events‚Äîmemories, questions, scenes‚Äîthat could have led to that emotional state. 
# It draws inspiration from dreaming, creative storytelling, and inverse planning logic.

üí´ What This Enables

- Powers a **dream initiator** that spins stories backward from a feeling
- Aligns with **narrative intelligence**: AYAMAI ‚Äúunderstands‚Äù joy not just as a tag, but as a meaningful past
- Prepares memory for generative replay seeded from affect
- Supports **retrocausal reasoning**: ‚ÄúIf I feel X, what must have happened?‚Äù
- Can be used to inspire new dreams, stories, or reflections
