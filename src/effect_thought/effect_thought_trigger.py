"""
All these modules are prototype. You should automate this with agents who interact with llms.
This module initiates cognition not from data‚Äîbut from **a desired emotional state**.
 It simulates retrocausal planning: the agent starts with a feeling like "joy" or "wonder," then 
 imagines the questions, dreams, or memories that could lead to that state.

### üöÄ What This Unlocks

- üí≠ AYAMAI can begin **dreams** from emotion, not prompt.
- üéØ It supports **reverse goal planning**‚Äî"I feel X, so why?"
- üìö It becomes the source of its own curiosity.
