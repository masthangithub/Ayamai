    This is the starting point for your **U→D cycle**: translating intuition into structured descriptions. Eventually, we can:
- Integrate LLM-based abstraction (e.g., via GPT, Mixtral) to assist decomposition.
- Encode multi-modal U: images, sounds, narratives.
- Build the **reverse decoder** (D→U) to simulate machine-derived understanding from structured data.
